# lethe

Self-improving memory store for LLM agents. BM25 + dense vector hybrid retrieval with cross-encoder reranking, clustered retrieval-induced forgetting, and optional LLM write-time enrichment.

Ships as a **Claude Code plugin** (`plugins/claude-code/`) that drops a `.lethe/` directory into each project, writes daily markdown memory via hooks, and surfaces prior-session context through a `memory-recall` skill.

## stack

- Python 3.12, managed with `uv`
- FAISS (faiss-cpu) for dense vector index
- rank_bm25 for sparse keyword index
- sentence-transformers: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (bi-encoder), ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 (cross-encoder)
- SQLite for metadata persistence
- numpy for vectors, matplotlib for plots, pytest for tests
- LongMemEval (S variant) + NFCorpus for benchmarks

## key architecture decisions

- BM25 + FAISS hybrid retrieval (BM25 is the strongest single signal on conversation data)
- Cross-encoder reranking on the merged candidate pool
- Adaptive search depth: shallow k=30 for confident queries, deep k=200 when unsure
- Cosine 0.95 dedup on add (removes 4.6% of LongMemEval, +6.5% NDCG)
- Tier lifecycle: naive → gc → memory (with decay and apoptosis)
- RIF: retrieval-induced forgetting suppresses chronic false positives at candidate selection stage
- SQLite + .npz + FAISS for persistence (no external services)

## benchmark results

LongMemEval S (200k turns, 500 questions, 200-query eval sample):

| System | NDCG@10 |
|--------|---------|
| Vector only | 0.1376 |
| BM25 only | 0.2420 |
| Hybrid RRF (memsearch style) | 0.2171 |
| **Hybrid + cross-encoder rerank** | **0.3680** |

The 0.3680 is from BM25+vector+cross-encoder reranking (standard IR). The GC mechanism does not improve this number. Verified with integrity checks.

## research status

17 checkpoints. Checkpoints 1-10 (GC mechanisms): all failed. Checkpoint 11 (global RIF): +1.1%. Checkpoint 12 (clustered RIF): +5.8%. Checkpoint 13 (clustered + rank-gap): +6.5% NDCG, +9.5% recall@30 — retrieval-only best. Checkpoint 14 (exploration + rescue list): negative at full scale. Checkpoint 15 (SDM research prototype in `sdm/`): negative. Checkpoint 16 (extended metrics for checkpoint 13): RIF's gain is primarily from reducing wrong_family (−1.6pp); sibling_confusion and stale_fact unchanged. Checkpoint 17 (LLM enrichment layer, Haiku write-time gist + anticipated queries + entities + temporal markers): **+8.3pp NDCG on covered queries (+21% rel over RIF), largest single-lever gain in the journey**. Overall diluted to +1.2pp by partial coverage (15% of queries). Full corpus enrichment expected ~$16.

## git commits

Use conventional commits. release-please is configured to only bump on `feat:` (minor) and `fix:` (patch). Use `feat:` or `fix:` only when you want a PyPI release. For everything else use a plain message with no prefix (release-please ignores non-conventional commits entirely).
